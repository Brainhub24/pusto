## My projects
[Mailur](/mailur/) – a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail.

[Tider](https://github.com/naspeh/tider) – a lightweight time tracker (GTK+). I use it to understand how much time I spend on which activities while I am working on my computer. And it also reminds me to take a break.

[Timefor](https://github.com/naspeh/timefor) – a command-line time tracker with [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) integration. New replacement for [Tider](/en/tider/)

[Pusto](https://github.com/naspeh/pusto) – a static site generator for this site.

All code and other projects you can find [on github.](https://github.com/naspeh)
