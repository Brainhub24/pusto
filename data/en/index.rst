I'm a pyhton developer living in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine.

My projects
-----------
`Mailr </en/mailr/>`_ -- a webmail client with gmail like conversations. It is at the 
beginning of development.

`Tider </en/tider/>`_ -- lightweight time tracker (GTK+). I use it to understand how much 
I have spent time on which activities while I am working on computer. And also remind me 
to take a break.

`Pusto <https://github.com/naspeh/pusto>`_ -- the source code of this site.

Napokaz__ -- a lightweight viewer of images from picasaweb__. It is a jQuery plugin 
without any other dependencies. It's been using on this site (for example `on trips page 
</trip/>`_).

Naya__ (outdated) -- experimental attempt to develop microframework based on Werkzeug__ 
without any other required dependencies. It was started when Flask__ was a single file.
