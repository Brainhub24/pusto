I'm a passionate python developer with over a decade of experience in web development. I'm especially strong in back-end development, good in automation and deployment (including CI/CD), occasionally I can do modern front-end.

I love simplicity. I usually choose fewer abstractions to be closer to the lower layer.

### I love open source. In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing perfection on my open source projects:
- [Mailur][mailur] – a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail
- [Timefor][gh-timefor] – a command-line time tracker (my first recent dive into golang)
- more projects on [github page.][gh-naspeh]
