.. | My English level is **intermediate.**
.. | I was born in April 1983.

I'm a python developer with over eight years experience in web development. I'm especially 
strong in back-end development, though I also can help you with front-end part and 
DevOps__ stuff. I'm perfectionist, anyway I can work on huge legacy codebase, it should 
have some beautiful parts at least.

I would like to work in a distributed team on an exciting web service (no games - they usually waste people's time, no advertising - I really don't like ads). I love open source and like teams which aim contributing back to the community.

I'm proud of Mailur__ -- a Gmail-inspired webmail.

More projects are here__ or on `github page`__.
