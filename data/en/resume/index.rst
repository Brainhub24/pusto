I'm a passionate python developer with over a decade of experience in web development. I'm especially strong in back-end development, good in automation and deployment (including CI/CD), occasionally I can do modern front-end.

I love simplicity. I usually choose fewer abstractions to be closer to the lower layer.

In my spare time, I enjoy pursuing perfection on my open source projects:
 - Mailur__ -- a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail
 - Timefor__ -- a command-line time tracker (my first dive into golang)
 - more projects on `github page.`__
