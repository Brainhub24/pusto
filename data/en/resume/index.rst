I'm a python developer with over a decade of experience in web development. I'm especially 
strong in back-end development, pretty good in deployment and automation, occasionally I can do modern front-end.

I usualy choose fewer abstractions to be closer to the low layer. I'm perfectionist and I like to optimize, automate, improve maintainability of existing codebases.

I'm proud of Mailur__ -- a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail.

More projects are here__ or on `github page`__.
