I'm a python developer with over a decade of experience in web development. I'm especially strong in back-end development, pretty good in automation, CI and deployment, occasionally I can do modern front-end.

I love simplicity. I usually choose fewer abstractions to be closer to the low layer.

In spare time (usually on long vacations or between jobs) I pursue perfection on my open source projects. The last one is Mailur__ -- a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail.

More projects are here__ or on `github page`__.
