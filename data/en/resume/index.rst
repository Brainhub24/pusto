I'm a passionate python developer living in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine. I really like 
simplicity and obviously my favorite principle is KISS__. I love python and its Zen__. I 
think `Unix phillosophy`__ is the best way to develop software. I want to work in 
distributed team on a really exciting piece of software (no games, no advertising, 
probably on some cool web service).
