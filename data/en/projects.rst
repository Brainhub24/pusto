My projects
-----------
`Namail </en/mailr/>`_ -- a webmail client with gmail like conversations. It is early in 
development.

`Tider </en/tider/>`_ -- lightweight time tracker (GTK+). I use it to understand how much 
time I have spent on which activities while I am working on computer. And it also reminds 
me to take a break.

`Pusto <https://github.com/naspeh/pusto>`_ -- the source code of this site.

Napokaz__ -- a lightweight viewer of images from picasaweb__. It is a jQuery plugin 
without any other dependencies. It's been used on this site (for example `on trips 
page`__).

Naya__ (outdated) -- an experimental attempt to develop microframework based on Werkzeug__ 
without any other required dependencies. It was started when Flask__ was still a single 
file.
