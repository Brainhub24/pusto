My projects
-----------
`Mailr </en/mailr/>`_ -- a webmail client with gmail like conversations. It is at the 
beginning of development.

`Tider </en/tider/>`_ -- lightweight time tracker (GTK+). I use it to understand how much 
I have spent time on which activities while I am working on computer. And it also remind 
me to take a break.

without any other dependencies. It's been using on this site (for example `on trips 
page`__).
