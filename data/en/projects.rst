My projects
-----------
`Mailur </mailur/>`_ -- a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail.

`Tider </en/tider/>`_ -- a lightweight time tracker (GTK+). I use it to understand how much time I spend on which activities while I am working on computer. And it also reminds me to take a break.

`Pusto <https://github.com/naspeh/pusto>`_ -- a static site generator for this site.

All code and other projects you can find on `github. <https://github.com/naspeh>`_
