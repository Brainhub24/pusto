# Mailur is a lightweight webmail inspired by Gmail [![RSS](../rss.png)](feed.xml)

## Features
- multiple tags for messages (no folders)

- [Sieve scripts for email filtering](/mailur/features/#sieve-scripts)
- [composing messages with Markdown](/mailur/features/#markdown)

Brand-new version uses [Dovecot as main storage][mlr-dovecot], no database required.

This version is already in use. It has minimal feature set I need on daily basis. I have big plans for this project and I'm still working on it when I have spare time.
